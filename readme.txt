Welcome to mycurses!

mycurses is a c++ wrapper around the ncurses library. It also can be used as a very simple layout manager.

Some Components and Layouts have been defined already. Inherit from these or the base Component / Layout classes when making your own.

Note that the Makefile expects .exe files to be built. You may need to modify it if you are not using windows.
